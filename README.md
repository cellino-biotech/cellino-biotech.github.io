A site to help teammembers manage development environments.

This webpage uses the documentation template from `mkdocs`, along with its supported material theme plugin. To learn about the `mkdocs` platform, follow this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YA_dA8C20).

To serve a local development instance:

```zsh
mkdocs serve
```
